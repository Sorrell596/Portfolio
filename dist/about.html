          </h3>
          <p>
            I completed my Associates of Applied Science in Computer Science
            with a 3.88 cumulative GPA. Throughout my academic career I learned
            HTML, CSS, PHP, MySQL, Javascript, Java, and Python. In my free time
            I took it upon myself to learn the basics of SCSS (which was used in
            the production of my portfolio), React, and Django. To see some of
            my project, please visit the
            <a href="work.html"><u>"My Work"</u></a>
